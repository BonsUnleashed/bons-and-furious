# Bons and Furious — notices

Copyright 2026 BonsUnleashed and contributors. Our code and modifications are
provided under GNU GPL version 3. The full text is in LICENSE.

This project patches other authors' installed Minecraft mods. Their names and
interfaces identify compatibility targets, and do not imply endorsement. Their
original code, assets and licenses remain their authors' property. Consult
upstream-credits.json for the exact dependency builds used during development.
License documents are retained under resources/META-INF/licenses with their
upstream project names. Those documents describe their respective upstream
works; they do not relicense other targets or their assets.

From 1.0.20 every patch is a mixin; the sources are in src/bons/furious/mixin/,
the helpers they call in src/. For targets under MIT, Apache-2.0, LGPL or GPL
licences some mixins carry a modified copy of a target method (an @Overwrite),
distributed with its source, build instructions and applicable notices. From
1.0.21 one mixin also carries a modified copy of Entity Texture Features'
Material.buffer handler (LGPL-3.0) in place of ETF's own, which it cancels.
From 1.0.23 the Colorwheel (LGPL-3.0) and OcclusionCulling (MIT, bundled in
EntityCulling) switches carry modified copies of the methods they replace.

For targets with restricted or unclear redistribution permissions (All Rights
Reserved, No-Derivatives or custom licences) and for Minecraft itself, the
mixins contain only our own code, attached with targeted injections; the
unchanged instructions stay in the installed class. The exceptions are a few
short methods that Forge's Mixin 0.8.5 can only change by replacing them whole
(interface methods, which accept no injection, and a method whose new logic is
our own algorithm): those replacements are written from the method's behaviour
and are marked with @Overwrite and a reason in the source. Every switch is bound to
the tested target builds by method fingerprints (patches/*.json), and a switch
whose fingerprints do not match is not applied at all. Trackwork model geometry
and the two Scorched functions are read from the installed target resources and
changed in memory. Their original resources are not included in this release.

Two MIT-licensed mixin libraries are bundled as Jar-in-Jar: MixinExtras 0.5.0
(LlamaLad7) and MixinSquared 0.3.6-beta.1 (Bawnorton). Their licence texts are
in resources/META-INF/licenses.

Minecraft and Forge are required external dependencies. No Minecraft or upstream
mod JAR is bundled. No upstream textures, sounds or promotional artwork are
included. Optional target mods must be obtained from their authors.

AI tools assisted development, testing and documentation; the creator reports
substantial implementation work outside those sessions.
